# A simplified tree of life

This repository is the code but it is live here: <https://porcoesphino.github.io/phylogeny/>

## Overview

I'd been building up sections of lists in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to try to learn parts of the tree of life after watching [Professor Dave's Zoology series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLybg94GvOJ9HpCr9iU9YXHa5kXj0Pp2dA). As I was looking throug different sources to extend them I started putting together more and more lists and notes and thought it was worth putting them somewhere I could quickly access, and to automate the Anki cloze card creation process just a little.
